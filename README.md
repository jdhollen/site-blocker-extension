# site-blocker-extension
a little site-blocking chrome extension.

this isn't meant to be pretty. it's two textareas.  one is a list of sites that
are blocked 24/7, and the other is a list of sites blocked during my work day.

you're probably better off with one of the "real" extensions that does this. i
just wanted a way to have two separate lists of blocked sites.
